## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

WebCrate helps you organize links, articles and more from around the web in a central place. You can add links from any device or directly from the browser using a Firefox/Chrome extension and organize them into different collections called crates. Share crates with anyone or subscribe to crates by other users to stay up to date.

- **Easy to use**: Minimal, focused and intuitive interface
- **Customizable**: Add your own context to each link and use emojis to distinguish crates
- **Sharing**: Share your links and crates with the world
- **Cross Platform**: Install as PWA and use Browser Extensions
- **Private**: WebCrate runs on [Deta Space](https://deta.space), a new personal cloud

## ðŸš€ Get Started

WebCrate runs on [Deta Space](https://deta.space), a new personal Cloud. After you sign up, you get your own instance of WebCrate, it is completely isolated from other users and we can't access it.

You can think of it like installing an app on your phone, but instead of the app being on your phone, it exists on the internet for you to access from all of your devices. You remain in control of your apps and your data.

After you sign up for [Deta Space](https://deta.space), install the [WebCrate App](https://deta.space/discovery/webcrate) and you are good to go ðŸŽ‰
